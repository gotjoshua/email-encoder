# Email Address Encoder for WordPress

A lightweight plugin to protect plain email addresses and mailto links from email-harvesting robots by encoding them into decimal and hexadecimal entities. Has effect on the posts, pages, comments, excerpts, text widgets and other filtered content. Works without JavaScript â€” just simple spam protection.
