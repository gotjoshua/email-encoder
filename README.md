# Email Address Encoder for WordPress

A lightweight plugin that protects plain email addresses and mailto links from email-harvesting robots by encoding them into decimal and hexadecimal entities. Has effect on the posts, pages, comments, excerpts, text widgets and other filtered content. Works without JavaScript â€” just simple spam protection.

## Installation

2. Login to your WordPress installation and activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ menu.
3. Use the "Page Scanner" under _Settings -> Email Encoder_ to test if your email addresses are protected.
